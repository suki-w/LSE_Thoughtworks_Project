# LSE_Thoughtworks_Project

-- Preview

A final project of the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator program, also an Employer's Project to be presented to and rated by the data analyst representative of Thoughtworks UK, leveraging real-life data retreived from the TFL and other relevent open data resources online. Conclusions and recommendations were based on data analysis conducted on Python, whereas data visualizations were developed on both Tableau and Python.

-- Project Background

Our team (a team of 4 with members with Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai and UK) was required to develop and present a data-informed plan to increase the uptake of cycling in London and to help the client better understand the factors that contribute to the uptake of cycling in the city.

-- Scenario

Having outlined the transport strategy for the next two decades in 2018, the Mayor of London has hired Thoughtworks to consult on how much progress has been made and ask for recommendations as to whether anything in the strategy needs to be adjusted. They are particularly interested in the changes in cycling behaviour and its impact on the overall strategy.

-- About the Client

The Greater London Authority (GLA) is the governance body for the Greater London region, which is the administrative area of London, UK. The GLA consists of two political branches: the executive Mayoralty (the Mayor of London) and the 25-member London Assembly. The London Assembly ensures the Mayor’s policies, actions, and strategies are in the public interest The GLA has powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. The responsible bodies for the delivery of these services are Transport for London, the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, and the London Fire Commissioner.

-- Business Questions

When approaching Thoughtworks, the Mayor of London proposed some initial questions:

• How can we increase the uptake of cycling in London?

• What are the main factors that determine whether people choose to cycle?

• What interventions and changes to the transport network have had the most impact on cycling engagement?

• What are the demographics of cyclists in these cities?

• Are there any underrepresented groups that can be engaged with to try to increase the uptake of cycling as a mode of transport?

-- Thoughtworks Hypothesis

Thoughtworks has selected these initial datasets to see how different cities compare in their uptake of cycling, with the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the availability of cycling infrastructure and the prevalence of cycling. Is this hypothesis correct? What might be other hypotheses for factors that affect the uptake of cycling – and can these be evidenced using additional data?
